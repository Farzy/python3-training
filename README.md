# Python 3 Training

## Synopsis

Personal project for practicing Python 3.

I use this project to practice Python, learn new features and stay up to date.
There is no guideline in the code, I just add modules while discovering features.

## Building

No build needed. Just run the main program. There is an online help available.
You can for example run only one exercice.

```bash
python3 training.py --help
```


## Testing

There are some tests, only in `exercises.py`:

```bash
python3 exercices.py [-v]
```

## Benchmarking

`cw-duplicate-encoder.py` has code to be benchmarked and uses `timeit`, run
the benchmarks with:

```bash
python3 codewars/duplicate_encoder.py
```

## Authors
